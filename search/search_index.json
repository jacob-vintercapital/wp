Diversification \u00b6 Portfolio theory has had a huge impact on finance. Markovitz, who won the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, invented portfolio theory in 1952 with his famous paper titled Portfolio Selection published in the Journal of Finance. Portfolio theory changed the lens through which assets are considered. Before Markovitz, investors held a small number of stocks and tended to evaluate their stocks in isolation. Today, almost all investors evaluates their portfolio as a whole before buying or selling assets. ![Investors can recieve better risk-adjusted returns by diversifying their holdings.](todo insert path to simple markovitz graph with only one type of assets. SP500 can be the ORP.) To understand why portfolios are attractive investments, we can utilize an \"efficient frontier plot\". Any textbook on portfolio theory contain a version of this graph. In the plot we see a collection of assets with their historical volatility on the x-axis and a their expected return on the y-axis. Holding one of these assets will give the investor a certain risk (volatility) for a certain reward (return). Investors want high returns and low volatility, so the upper left corner is an ideal place to be. When comparing assets agsinst each other there is, of course, a trade-off between risk and reward: taking on more risk (by for example selling some T-bills and investing in a startup) does increase the expected return but also leads to higher volatility. The efficient frontier is the set of (return, volatility)-points the investor can get if they buy a portfolio of assets, and it is illustrated with a solid black line in the figure. Every single point on the efficient frontier is a portfolio the investor can have. The efficient frontier is located close to the ideal upper left corner, reflecting the fact that portfolios are more attractive than owning a single asset. The reason for this is diversification. ![](corr plot of sp500 and 10 or 20 assets.) Correlation is the driver of diversification. When the assets are correlated less than 1.00 with each other, it is possible to increase the risk-adjusted returns by diversifying. The lower the correlations between the assets, the more this solid line will expand to the upper left corner. Here is an important but subtle point: Even though an asset like gold might have inferior risk adjusted returns to some stocks, it can be rational for an investor to include gold in his portfolio because doing so improves the portfolio as a whole. Diversification stems from correlation, and if gold has a low correlation with stocks then including it will lead to better risk-adjusted returns of the entire portfolio. Indexing and cryptocurrencies \u00b6 Portfolio theory has not influenced the cryptocurrency market yet. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and many hundreds are traded on large exchanges. But out of the few people that have bought cryptocurrencies, owning only 1-3 different cryptocurrencies is the norm. Just like different companies operate in distinct sectors, different cryptocurrencies try to solve different problems - some focus on building a general purpose scripting language and others on integrating their software with the current banking system. Just like stocks, cryptocurrencies have a lower correlation that makes them suitable to be included in a portfolio. As seen in the figure, the correlation between cryptocurrencies is around 0.20 which is lower than the correlation between stocks.

Before money societies relied on gifts and barter, both of which severly limits trade. Gifts limits a transaction's value and whom we can trade with, since knowing the person or having a history of successful gift exchanges would be required for valuable trades to take place. ((Another drawback with gifts are that they rely on humans remembering the quality and amount of the good which was recieved, and this is a common source of conflicts.)) Barter limits the liquidity and frequence of trade, because if paying in-kind is the only option then both the buyer and the seller must be willing to buy and sell each other goods simoultaneuously. This requires a coincidence of wants, which is unlikely. For example, what should the fisherman do when he has caught more than he is able to eat? Perhaps the fisherman need clothe, but if his society relies on barter then he must find a tailor today - otherwise the fish will be worthless. The tailor might not be hungry, but in this case the fisherman might be able to trade the fish for nuts, the nuts for beer, and the beer for clothes. Obviously the coincidence of wants introduces liquidity and accounting problems: will there be a path from fish to clothes via trading, and what are the appropriate exchange ratios for all goods? In an economy with 100 goods there are 4950 prices to keep track of. Moreover, barter is impossible for the musician who needs to pay rent to his house landlord. Money solves these problems. All goods can be priced in terms of only one other good so that there are not thousands of exchange rates to keep track of (money is a unit of account). And the musician can recieve money when he plays the piano at a bar (money is a medium of exchange). He can use these money later to pay his rent (money is a store of value). Money can be defined in terms of its functions as a a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Anything that fulfills these properties can be used as money. Throughout history we have used many forms of money: seashells, knifes, cows, alcohol, and large stones formed in the shape of doughnuts. All of these fall under the category of commodity money. All commodity money is easy to understand, and most of them function reasonably well as a unit of account. Some commodities are more money than others, thanks to their proporties such as look, weight, divisibility, and scarcity. Gold and solver coins was introduced in 600 BC, and later on many societies used coins that had been issued by the king. Paper money was used in China during the 11th century due to the physical hurdles with commodity money. Gold and silver merchants gave out reciepts which could redeemed for a certain amount of the commodity. This form of money fall under the category of representative money. The reciepts were in essence IOUs because it was the person who held the reciept who had the right to redeem it. Paper money came to Europe during the 13th century, and by the 18th century gold coins had been replaced by paper money backed by gold. This monetary system is referred to as the gold standard. The paper notes were backed by gold in the sense that they were convertible into a certain amount of gold.

This gives Bitcoin a bad reputation that it does not deserve. Criminals have use and will always use technology when performing illegal activities. The technology they use can be cars, cell phones, cash, bitcoin, etc. We rarely blaim the US dollar or post offices which both facilitate high volume of illegal trades, e.g. guns bought with cash. ((The same logic should apply to other currencies.)) Researchers estimate todo percent of all bitcoin transactions come from illegal activity, 2 whereas todo percent of all Cash in USD cash transactions come from illegal acticity. 3 more sections \u00b6 todo: read https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths and include some of these, such as - 1 - 2 - 7 - 17 - 33 but try to make it less bitcoin focues and more crypto focues, if possible. no intrisic value \u00b6 above we noted that a blockchain digitize trust, and can be used to replace current intermediaries, so from this use case it has value. moreover, it also has value because it's a network in which value can be transfered - the internet is a network where information can be sent. Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc...

Portolio thinking \u00b6 When considering whether or not to invest in an asset, an investor should study the asset not in isolation but rather as a part of the entire portfolio. It does not make sense to exclude Twitter from SP500 simply because the stock is too risky for one's risk preference. Rather, one should compare the SP500 with Twitter included vs the SP500 with Twitter excluded. After comparing the two portfolios sector allocation, risk-return profiles, etc then the investor can make a decision of whether to exclude Twitter or not from his portoflio. Low correlations \u00b6 ![Digital assets and traditional financial assets exhibit low - sometimes negative - correlations. Hence digital assets can be used to diversify a traditional portfolio.](path to file containg 1 or 2 correlation matrix plots.) The primary conclusion to draw from this matrix is that the correlation between virtual currencies and traditional assets are far below one, hence they can be used to diversify a traditional portfolio. It seems like the crypto asset class exhibit different return patterns than traditional financial assets such as gold and stocks. The secondary conclusion to draw from this matrix is that the correlation between different virtual currencies are below one, reflecting the fact that these these currencies are different from each other. This correlation between assets in BlockchainX is a reason to hold our certificate, since a strategy of buying merely Bitcoin and Ethereum would miss out on the other 8 assets which are diversifiers thanks to their low (and sometimes negative) correlations. Moreover, only buying two assets rather than a basket is sub-optimal due to performance reversals. Performance reversals \u00b6 For a long period Bitcoin outperformed almost all other virtual currencies in the top 10 index. During the price drop of Bitcoin in January 2018, three of the top 10 digital assets - EOS, NEO and Stellar - realized positive returns. Only twice in 12 months has the top-performing coin repeated the feat of being the best performer in the following month. 1 These performance reversals clearly demonstrate the benefits of diversification. It also provides a good reason to buy a slice of the market, instead of trying to pick a few virtual currencies and hope they will perform. Expansion of the efficient frontier \u00b6 Let us be crystal clear in our analysis of adding virtual currencies to a traditional portfolio, by re-visiting the traditional \"efficient frontier plot\". The reason why a correlation matrix matter to an investor is that the correlation structure allows him to enjoy higher risk-adjusted returns. When the correlation between the assets are lowered, the portfolio's volatility is lowered too. So what happens when we add cryptocurrencies (market in the figure as crosses) to the universe of investable assets? Cryptohtmlcurrencies are marked in the figure as crosses. Thanks the statistical properties of these assets - namely their returns, volatility and correlation structure - the efficient frontier expands to the left. This expanded efficient frontier is drawn as a dashed gray line in the figure. Thus investors who include cryptocurrencies in their portfolio can enjoy better risk-adjusted returns, which is a logical result since adding choices always leaves an investor better off. ![Adding digital assets expands the efficient frontier.](traditional markovitz efficient frontier plot e.g. Efficient-Portfolio-Frontier with two asset classes. and a figure with corr matrix to the left maybe?)

Rebalanced whenever weight in BLX go above 7% or below 3%. good text from the report \u00b6 This report explores the case for including a small but meaningful allocation to cryptoassets in a diversified portfolio. Specifically, it examines the impact that a 1%, 5%, and 10% allocation to Bitcoin would have had on a traditional 60% equity/40% bond portfolio since Jan. 1, 2014. The potential impact was large: With a 5% allocation, for instance, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio nearly doubled, total returns more than doubled, and the maximum drawdown was substantially reduced. The study looked at the period Jan. 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018. This period was chosen because it captures two of the worst bear markets in Bitcoin history: The 85% pullback from January 2014 through January 2015, and the 64% decline from December 2017 through the conclusion of the study in March 2018. The study considered looking at returns since Bitcoin\u2019s inception on publicly available exchanges in 2010, but the early returns of Bitcoin were so high that they skew the analysis. In 2013, for example, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose 5,507% (see table). The chosen start date captures what amounts to the worst historical scenario for adding Bitcoin to a portfolio. Despite this (intentionally) adverse timing, the study found that a systematic allocation to Bitcoin significantly increased the portfolio\u2019s risk-adjusted returns, assuming a diligent rebalancing strategy was in place. In fact, a small allocation to Bitcoin achieved this result without increasing the risk profile of the portfolio in any meaningful way. The results were remarkable: The \u201cQuarterly Rebalanced Portfolio\u201d captured similar returns as the HODL Portfolio (58.51% vs. 67.70%), but did so with less than half the risk (9.0% vs. 19.8%). Quarterly rebalancing also massively reduced the maximum drawdown, which fell from -32.68% to just -9.25%. This drawdown was actually lower than the maximum drawdown experienced by the Traditional Portfolio (which didn\u2019t hold Bitcoin at all). In an effort to better constrain Bitcoin\u2019s weight in the portfolio, the study looked at a Tolerance-Based rebalancing strategy using a 50% tolerance. That meant rebalancing the 5% Bitcoin allocation any time it hit 7.5% or 2.5%. todo: which 12 months? was it the most recent 12 months? or during 2017? \u21a9","title":"Crypto portfolio"},{"location":"two/portfoliocase/#the-case-for-crypto-in-an-institutional-portfolio","text":"todovip: write a bullish section.","title":"The case for crypto in an institutional portfolio"},{"location":"two/portfoliocase/#portolio-thinking","text":"When considering whether or not to invest in an asset, an investor should study the asset not in isolation but rather as a part of the entire portfolio.
